# Challenge : Coding a search with the wikipedia's API

The aim of this project is to code a search system using the Wikipedia's API.
The user can perform a search and see results that can be clicked on if they want to move to the page of the concerned article.

This type of task is quite popular in all websites today. That's why I'm doing this project in the following steps :
- Coding a basic interface (page structure)
- Coding the JavaScript features
- Adding style to the interface to complete the project (page style).

Otherwise, this project consists of :
- using the wikipedia's API URL to make some searches
- adding a loader
- managing errors with Fetch or others.
